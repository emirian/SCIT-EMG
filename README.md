How Clinical Immobilization test is affected by EMG measurements from the leg
Using Bitalino EMG sensor readings and EDF reader in "R", I am trying to first extract some features to represent each subject's force profile.
Then, by training a classifier per each of the following goals, I try to predict the output class:
- Tension
- Urge to Move
- Sensorimotor
- Movement
